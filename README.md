# MSFTBandLib

Microsoft Band library for C# applications using .NET Standard.

This library contains a reverse-engineering of the Microsoft Band's proprietary Bluetooth protocol to enable new client sync applications to be developed for the Band after official support ends on May 31, 2019.

The sole intention of this project is to provide Microsoft Band owners with a solution to continue using their devices beyond the end of support, with a view to eventually enabling a new community client app to be developed for mobile devices.

MSFTBandLib is currently **experimental** and reliant on native Bluetooth implementations for interfacing with Band devices.

This project is based on the groundbreaking work of (TODO: CITATIONS).
